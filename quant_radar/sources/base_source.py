"""Source ABC + registry — the plug-and-play surface for *time-series* adapters.

Scope: this ABC is for sources that produce a ``pandas.DataFrame`` with a
``DatetimeIndex``. News sources (``gdelt``, ``finnhub``) return
``list[dict]`` of articles instead and intentionally don't conform —
see ``quant_radar.tools.news`` and SKILL.md's "News sources" section.

Each adapter module declares a ``Source`` subclass with four methods:

1. ``capability`` — its ``SourceCapability`` from the catalog (columns,
   intervals, auth, etc.)
2. ``supports(ref)`` — does this source handle a given ``DataRef``?
3. ``fetch(ref, refresh)`` — return the normalized DataFrame.
4. ``search(query, limit)`` + ``describe(name)`` — discovery surface
   (per the universal contract; return ``[]``/``None`` if upstream
   genuinely doesn't expose them).

Subclasses register themselves at import time via ``register_source``
so ``hydrate()`` becomes a one-line registry lookup. Adding a new
source is: write the module, register the class, add a catalog entry.
No changes to the dispatch layer.

See ``scripts/scaffold_source.py`` for a scaffold generator, and
SKILL.md "Adding a new source — the waterfall" for the four-step
shortlist (existing lib → OpenBB → MCP → hand-written).

    Every adapter must satisfy four capabilities so the agent has the

    - ``supports(ref)`` — gate dispatch
